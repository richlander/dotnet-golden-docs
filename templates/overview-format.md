# Overview Format Specification

**Document Type**: `overview.md`
**Purpose**: Conceptual foundation document for LLM consumption
**Target**: Consumption graph output
**Generated By**: ContentGenerator tool

## Purpose

The overview document provides conceptual foundation and high-level understanding of a topic without diving into implementation details. It serves as the entry point for LLMs to understand the topic's role, importance, and relationships within the broader .NET ecosystem.

## Structure Requirements

### Header
```markdown
# [Topic Name] Overview

Brief one-sentence description of what this topic covers.
```

### Core Sections

1. **What It Is** (Required)
   - Clear definition of the topic
   - Primary purpose and use cases
   - Key characteristics that distinguish it from related topics

2. **Why It Matters** (Required)
   - Importance within .NET ecosystem
   - Problems it solves
   - Benefits for developers

3. **Key Concepts** (Required)
   - 3-5 fundamental concepts that define the topic
   - Brief explanation of each concept
   - How concepts relate to each other

4. **Common Scenarios** (Required)
   - Typical use cases and applications
   - When to choose this topic over alternatives
   - Real-world application examples

5. **Related Topics** (Optional)
   - Cross-references to other .NET topics
   - Complementary technologies
   - Dependencies and prerequisites

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Conceptual Focus**: Emphasize understanding over implementation
- **Clear and Accessible**: Understandable to developers with varying .NET experience
- **Authoritative**: Based on official sources and best practices
- **Concise**: Efficient information density without unnecessary elaboration

### Technical Requirements
- **No Code Examples**: Overview documents are concept-focused
- **Avoid Implementation Details**: Save specifics for one-shot and examples documents
- **Cross-Linking**: Reference related topics using HAL+JSON navigation patterns

### Content Scope
- **Breadth Over Depth**: Cover the topic comprehensively at a high level
- **Context Setting**: Establish the topic's place in the .NET ecosystem
- **Foundation Building**: Prepare readers for more detailed consumption in other document types

## Token Budget

Overview documents are **not token-budgeted** - they should be as long as necessary to provide comprehensive conceptual coverage while maintaining efficient information density.

## Quality Standards

### Similarity Requirements
- Must maintain >0.7 similarity to corresponding `golden-reference.md`
- Warning threshold: 0.5-0.7 similarity
- Error threshold: <0.5 similarity

### Content Validation
- All statements must be verifiable against official .NET documentation
- Claims about importance and use cases must reflect real-world usage patterns
- Conceptual explanations must be accurate and complete

## Generation Notes

When ContentGenerator creates overview documents:

1. **Source Analysis**: Analyze `golden-reference.md` for key concepts and scope
2. **Conceptual Extraction**: Identify core concepts without implementation details
3. **Ecosystem Context**: Position topic within broader .NET landscape
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Identify and reference related topics appropriately

The overview serves as the conceptual anchor for all other generated content types for the topic.
