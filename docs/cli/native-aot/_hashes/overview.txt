Description | Native AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation is a publishing model that compiles .NET applications directly to native code at build time, eliminating the need for a just-in-time (JIT) compiler at runtime. This results in faster startup times, reduced memory footprint, and self-contained executables that don't require the .NET runtime to be installed on the target machine.
