# C# Language
## Essential Language Features
### Modern Language Features

Pattern Matching: Expressions that enable you to inspect data and make decisions based on its characteristics. Pattern matching provides great syntax for control flow based on data, using constructs like switch expressions and the `_` catch-all "discard" pattern.

Collection Expressions: Common syntax to provide collection values using `[` and `]` characters, with support for the `..` spread element to expand collections.

Index and Range Expressions: Retrieve one or more elements from indexable collections using `^` for "from the end" indexing and `..` for range expressions.

Tuples: Lightweight data structures that are ordered, fixed-length sequences of values with optional names and individual types, enclosed in `(` and `)` characters.

LINQ (Language Integrated Query): Provides a common pattern-based syntax to query or transform any collection of data, unifying syntax for in-memory collections, databases, XML, JSON, and cloud-based data APIs.

### Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming support is a first-class feature of the C# programming language, which provides the `async` and `await` keywords that make it easy to write and compose asynchronous operations while still enjoying the full benefits of all the control flow constructs the language has to offer. C# was the first mainstream language to introduce `async` and `await`.

The .NET platform provides concurrency and parallelization support at multiple levels of abstraction, both via libraries and deeply integrated into C#. From low-level `Thread` and `ThreadPool` classes to high-level `Task` representations and `Parallel.ForEach` patterns, C# offers comprehensive concurrency support. C# also supports `await foreach` for iterating collections backed by asynchronous operations.
