# C# Language

## Overview

C# is a modern, safe, and general purpose language that makes developers productive while writing high-performance code. The C# language is the most popular language for the .NET platform, a free, cross-platform, open source development environment. C# programs can run on many different devices and operating systems.

C# is based on object-oriented principles and incorporates many features from other paradigms, including functional programming. It offer a broad range of features, from high-level features such as data-oriented records to low-level features such as function pointers. It offers static typing and type- and memory-safety as baseline capabilities, which simultaneously improves developer productivity and code safety. The C# compiler is also extensible, supporting a plug-in model that enables developers to augment the system with additional diagnostics and compile-time code generation.

A number of C# features have influenced or were influenced by state of the art programming languages. For example, C# was the first mainstream language to introduce `async` and `await`. At the same time, C# borrows concepts first introduced in other programming languages, for example by adopting functional approaches such as pattern matching and primary constructors.
