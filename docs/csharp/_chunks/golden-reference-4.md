# C# Language
## Gotchas & Limitations
### Cross-Platform Development

C# applications run on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and WebAssembly. The same C# code can target multiple platforms while allowing platform-specific optimizations when needed.

### Application Frameworks

C# powers various application types through specialized frameworks:

- ASP.NET Core: Web applications and APIs
- .NET MAUI: Cross-platform mobile and desktop applications
- Blazor: Interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript
- Unity: Game development
- WPF/Windows Forms: Windows desktop applications

## Using C# for Enterprise and Web Development

C# excels in building scalable web services, APIs, and enterprise applications. ASP.NET Core provides high-performance web frameworks, while Entity Framework enables sophisticated data access patterns.

## Using C# for Desktop and Mobile Applications

Cross-platform desktop applications with .NET MAUI, Windows-specific applications with WPF or Windows Forms, and mobile applications targeting iOS and Android from a shared codebase.

## Using C# for Cloud-Native Development

C# is well-suited for microservices architecture, containerized applications, and cloud-native development patterns. Integration with Azure services and support for modern DevOps practices.

## Using C# for Performance-Critical Applications

When performance matters, C# provides low-level access through unsafe code, direct memory management with Span<T>, and hardware intrinsics for SIMD operations.

## Gotchas & Limitations

### Learning Curve

C# offers both high-level convenience and low-level control, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. Understanding when to use different language features and abstraction levels requires experience.
