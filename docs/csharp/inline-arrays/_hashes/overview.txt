Title | Inline Arrays
Description | Inline arrays provide a type-safe and ref-safe mechanism for creating fixed-size sequential data structures using the `InlineArrayAttribute`. This C# 12 feature enables developers to create custom buffer types with compile-time known sizes, offering a safe alternative to unsafe fixed-size buffers while maintaining performance characteristics similar to arrays with full GC tracking and bounds checking.
