Description | Type extensions in C# enable developers to add methods, properties, and operators to existing types without modifying source code or creating derived types. C# 14 introduces modern extension block syntax that supports both instance and static members, expanding upon the traditional extension method pattern from C# 3.0. Both syntaxes remain fully supported and binary compatible.
