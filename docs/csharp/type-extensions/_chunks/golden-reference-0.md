# Type Extensions

## Overview

Type extensions in C# enable developers to augment existing types with additional members — methods, properties, and operators — without modifying the original type's source code or creating derived types. C# 14 introduces a new `extension` block syntax that unifies and expands upon the traditional extension method pattern. The new extension syntax supports both instance and static members, including properties and operators, providing a more natural and comprehensive way to extend types throughout the .NET ecosystem.

Extension members are particularly valuable when working with types you don't control, such as framework types, third-party libraries, or sealed classes. They enable you to create domain-specific APIs, implement the Adapter pattern, and add LINQ-like query capabilities to custom collections. The compiler transforms extension members into static methods, ensuring no runtime overhead while maintaining the illusion of native type members.
