Description | Object initialization encompasses the various approaches for creating and initializing objects and their properties in C#, including constructor-based initialization, object initializer syntax, collection initializers within objects, anonymous types, init-only properties, and required members. This covers both object creation patterns and the initialization of collections as properties of those objects.
