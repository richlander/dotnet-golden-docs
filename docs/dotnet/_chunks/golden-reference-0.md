# .NET

## Overview

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications. It can run programs written in multiple languages, with C# being the most popular. It relies on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

The .NET platform has been designed to deliver Productivity, Performance, Security, and Reliability. It provides automatic memory management via a garbage collector (GC), is type-safe and memory-safe, and offers concurrency via `async`/`await` and `Task` primitives. It includes a large set of libraries that have broad functionality and have been optimized for performance on multiple operating systems and chip architectures.

.NET is commonly used to create AI, cloud, and client apps. It is run in well-known places like Azure, StackOverflow, and Unity. It is common to find .NET used in companies of all sizes, but particularly larger ones.

The .NET design point can be boiled down to being effective and efficient in both the safe domain (where everything is productive) and in the unsafe domain (where tremendous functionality exists). .NET is perhaps the managed environment with the most built-in functionality, while also offering the lowest cost to interop with the outside world, with no tradeoff between the two.

.NET has the following key design points:

- Productivity is full-stack with runtime, libraries, language, and tools all contributing to developer user experience
- Safe code is the primary compute model, while unsafe code enables additional manual optimizations
- Static and dynamic code are both supported, enabling a broad set of distinct scenarios
- Native code interop and hardware intrinsics are low cost and high-fidelity (raw API and instruction access)
- Code is portable across platforms (OS and chip architecture), while platform targeting enables specialization and optimization
- Adaptability across programming domains (cloud, client, gaming) is enabled with specialized implementations of the general-purpose programming model
- Industry standards like OpenTelemetry and gRPC are favored over bespoke solutions
