# .NET
## Using .NET for Enterprise and Cloud Applications

.NET excels in building scalable web services, APIs, and cloud-native applications. The runtime's performance characteristics and extensive library ecosystem make it well-suited for high-throughput server applications.

## Using .NET for Cross-Platform Desktop and Mobile

With .NET MAUI and Avalonia, developers can build applications that run across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android from a single codebase.

## Using .NET for High-Performance Computing

Low-level features like Span<T>, hardware intrinsics, and unsafe code enable manual optimizations for performance-critical paths while maintaining the safety and productivity of the managed environment.

## Gotchas & Limitations

### Memory Management Trade-offs

While garbage collection eliminates many memory bugs, it can introduce pauses that may not be suitable for very tight latency requirements. Memory usage is typically higher than manual memory management.

### Platform-Specific Features

While .NET is cross-platform, some features and APIs are platform-specific. Developers need to be aware of these differences when targeting multiple platforms.

### Learning Curve

The extensive feature set and multiple abstraction levels can be overwhelming for newcomers. The "convenience spectrum" means developers need to understand when to use high-level vs. low-level APIs.
