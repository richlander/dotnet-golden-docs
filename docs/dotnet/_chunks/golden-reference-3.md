# .NET
## Relationships & Integration
### Cross-Platform and Multi-Architecture

.NET runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and WebAssembly. Microsoft maintains several binary distributions, while the community primarily maintains Linux distributions. Code is portable across platforms (OS and chip architecture) while platform targeting enables specialization and optimization. Supported on Arm64, x64, and x86 architectures.

### Open Source and Community

.NET is free, open source, and is a .NET Foundation project. It's maintained by Microsoft and the community on GitHub in several repositories, licensed with the MIT license. Regular updates ensure users deploy secure and reliable applications, with monthly updates on Patch Tuesday and annual releases in November.

### Interoperability and Industry Standards

.NET has been explicitly designed for low-cost interop with native libraries. Programs can seamlessly call operating system APIs or tap into the vast ecosystem of C/C++ libraries using modern source-generated solutions and function pointers. Industry standards like OpenTelemetry and gRPC are favored over bespoke solutions.

### Development Ecosystem

Higher-level components like .NET tools and app stacks (ASP.NET Core, MAUI, Windows Forms, WPF) build on top of the core pillars. NuGet is the package manager containing hundreds of thousands of packages. The SDK enables a modern developer experience with tools that can build, analyze, and test code, often with a single `dotnet build` command.
