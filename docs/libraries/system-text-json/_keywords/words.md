# Unified Local Analysis

Combined 2 compound terms and 152 single words
Total unique terms: 154
Terms with score ≥ 3.0: 16
Total term occurrences: 231
Header-based scoring: enabled

Scoring formula: LocalScore = count × header_multiplier × type_multiplier
- header_multiplier (compounds only): 1.5x (H1), 1.25x (H2), 1.1x (H3+), 1.0x (none)
  - Single words do NOT get header multipliers (prevents arbitrary matches)
  - Exception: Acronyms (all-caps, 2+ letters) get 1.25x boost regardless
- type_multiplier: 1.5x (compound), 1.0x (single)
- Minimum score threshold: 3.0 (only terms meeting this threshold are shown)
