# System.Text.Json - What's New in .NET 10

## Overview

.NET 10 introduces several important improvements to `System.Text.Json` focused on security, validation, I/O performance, and source generation. These enhancements help developers build more secure APIs, process JSON more efficiently, ensure data integrity, and handle circular references in generated serializers. The key additions include strict serialization options for secure-by-default deserialization, duplicate property detection to prevent ambiguity attacks, `PipeReader` support for high-performance streaming scenarios, and `ReferenceHandler` support in source generation.

This topic covers features added in .NET 10. For complete `System.Text.Json` information, see more general documentation.
