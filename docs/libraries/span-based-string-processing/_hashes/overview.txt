Title | Span-Based String Processing
Description | Span-based string processing enables high-performance text operations without heap allocations by using `Span<char>`, `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, and related types. This approach allows developers to process strings, perform conversions, and manipulate text data with minimal memory overhead. The .NET runtime and libraries provide extensive support for span-based operations including UTF-8 processing without string conversions, span-based Unicode normalization, hex string conversion using UTF-8 spans, and pattern matching directly on `ReadOnlySpan<char>`. These techniques eliminate temporary string allocations, reduce garbage collection pressure, and enable efficient text processing in performance-critical scenarios while maintaining type safety and readability.
