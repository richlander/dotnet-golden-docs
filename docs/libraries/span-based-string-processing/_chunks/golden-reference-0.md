# Span-Based String Processing

## Overview

Span-based string processing enables high-performance text operations without heap allocations. By using `Span<char>`, `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, and related types, you can process strings, perform conversions, and manipulate text data with minimal memory overhead. The .NET runtime and libraries provide extensive support for span-based operations, including UTF-8 processing, string normalization, hex conversion, and pattern matching.

Key capabilities include:

- **Zero-allocation text processing**: Process strings without creating temporary string objects
- **UTF-8 direct processing**: Work with UTF-8 data without converting to UTF-16 strings
- **Span-based string normalization**: Normalize Unicode strings without allocating new strings
- **Hex string conversion**: Convert between binary data and hex representations using UTF-8 spans
- **Pattern matching on spans**: Use pattern matching directly on `ReadOnlySpan<char>` for efficient text analysis
- **First-class span support**: C# 14 provides implicit conversions and natural syntax for span types

These techniques are particularly valuable when:

1. Processing text in hot code paths where allocations impact performance
2. Working with large text data or streams
3. Converting between different text encodings efficiently
4. Parsing or validating text without creating intermediate strings
