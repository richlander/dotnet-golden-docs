# System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonReader - Topic Specification

## Feature Description

System.Text.Json.Utf8JsonReader is a high-performance, low-allocation, forward-only reader for UTF-8 encoded JSON text. It provides the lowest-level API for reading JSON, operating directly on UTF-8 bytes without allocation and offering maximum control over parsing. Utf8JsonReader is designed for performance-critical scenarios where streaming, minimal allocation, and complete parsing control are essential.
