Description | `Task` and `Task<T>` are types that represent asynchronous operations in .NET, forming the foundation of the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP). `Task` represents an operation with no return value, while `Task<T>` represents an operation that produces a value of type `T`. These types work seamlessly with async/await keywords, provide state tracking and exception handling, and enable composable asynchronous programming across the .NET ecosystem.
