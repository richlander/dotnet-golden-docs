Title | JSON Validation and Security
Description | JSON validation and security features in System.Text.Json help ensure that deserialized data is correct, complete, and safe. These features protect against common security vulnerabilities like duplicate property attacks, enforce data contracts through strict validation, and ensure type safety with nullable reference types and required properties. The Strict serialization preset provides secure-by-default configuration, while individual validation features can be enabled separately. Duplicate property detection prevents ambiguity and potential security exploits, unmapped member handling ensures JSON matches expected type contracts, and nullable/required property validation enforces C# type constraints during deserialization. These capabilities are essential for securely processing untrusted JSON from external sources.
