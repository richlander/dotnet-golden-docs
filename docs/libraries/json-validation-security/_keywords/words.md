# Keywords for json-validation-security

Combined local and global scoring:
- Score = count × header_mult × type_mult × global_mult
- header_mult: 1.5x (H1), 1.25x (H2), 1.1x (H3+), 1.0x (none) [compounds only]
- type_mult: 1.5x (compound), 1.0x (single)
- global_mult: 2.0x (<10% of topics), 1.5x (10-25%), 1.0x (≥25%)
