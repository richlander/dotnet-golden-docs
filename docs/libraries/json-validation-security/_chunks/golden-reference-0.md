# JSON Validation and Security

## Overview

JSON validation and security features in `System.Text.Json` help ensure that deserialized data is correct, complete, and safe. These features protect against common security vulnerabilities like duplicate property attacks, enforce data contracts through strict validation, and ensure type safety with nullable reference types and required properties. By combining these capabilities, you can deserialize JSON with confidence that the data meets your application's requirements.

Key validation and security capabilities include:

- **Strict serialization options**: Preset configuration that enforces best practices for secure deserialization
- **Duplicate property detection**: Prevent ambiguity and potential security issues from duplicate JSON properties
- **Unmapped member handling**: Control what happens when JSON contains properties not defined in your types
- **Nullable reference type support**: Enforce nullability contracts during deserialization
- **Required property validation**: Ensure mandatory properties are present in JSON payloads
- **Type safety**: Validate that JSON data matches expected C# type contracts

These features are particularly valuable when:

1. Deserializing untrusted JSON from external sources (APIs, user input, files)
2. Enforcing strict data contracts in microservices or API boundaries
3. Preventing security vulnerabilities from malformed or malicious JSON
4. Ensuring data integrity in critical business logic
