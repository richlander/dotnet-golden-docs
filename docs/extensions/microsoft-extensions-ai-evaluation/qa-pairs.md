# Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation - Q&A Pairs

## Basic Concepts

Q: What is Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation?
A: Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation is a comprehensive set of .NET libraries designed to evaluate the quality and safety of AI-generated responses. It provides evaluators for quality metrics, safety checks, and NLP comparisons.

Q: What are the main types of evaluators available?
A: There are three main types: Quality evaluators (relevance, truth, completeness), Safety evaluators (harmful content detection), and NLP evaluators (BLEU, GLEU, F1 scores).

Q: Which packages should I install for basic evaluation?
A: For basic evaluation, install Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation (core abstractions), Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation.Quality (quality metrics), and optionally Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation.Safety (safety checks).

Q: Do I need Azure services to use evaluation?
A: Azure services are only required for advanced safety evaluators through Azure AI Foundry. Quality and NLP evaluators can work without Azure dependencies.

## Quality Evaluation

Q: How do quality evaluators work?
A: Quality evaluators use LLMs to assess AI responses based on metrics like relevance, truthfulness, completeness, fluency, and coherence. They provide scores and reasoning for the evaluation.

Q: What is the difference between relevance and truth evaluators?
A: Relevance evaluators assess whether the response addresses the input question appropriately. Truth evaluators verify the factual accuracy of the response content.

Q: How do I interpret quality evaluation scores?
A: Quality scores typically range from 0.0 to 1.0, where higher scores indicate better quality. Scores above 0.7 are generally considered good, while scores below 0.5 may indicate issues.

Q: Can I customize quality evaluation criteria?
A: Yes, you can implement custom evaluators by inheriting from IEvaluator interface and defining your own scoring logic and criteria.

## Safety Evaluation

Q: What safety evaluators are available?
A: Safety evaluators include ContentHarmEvaluator for general harmful content, ProtectedMaterialEvaluator for copyright issues, and specialized evaluators for hate speech, violence, and self-harm detection.

Q: How do safety evaluators connect to Azure AI Foundry?
A: Safety evaluators require an Azure AI Foundry endpoint and credentials. Configure them with the service endpoint URL and DefaultAzureCredential or specific authentication.

Q: What happens if a safety evaluator detects harmful content?
A: Safety evaluators return a score indicating the level of risk and reasoning explaining the detection. You can set thresholds and implement appropriate responses based on the evaluation results.

Q: Can safety evaluators work offline?
A: No, advanced safety evaluators require connection to Azure AI Foundry service. However, you can implement basic local safety checks using custom evaluators.

## NLP Evaluation

Q: What are NLP evaluators used for?
A: NLP evaluators compare AI responses to reference texts using traditional natural language processing metrics like BLEU, GLEU, and F1 scores without requiring additional AI service calls.

Q: When should I use NLP evaluators vs quality evaluators?
A: Use NLP evaluators when you have reference texts to compare against and want fast, deterministic evaluation. Use quality evaluators for more nuanced assessment of response quality.

Q: How do BLEU scores work in evaluation?
A: BLEU scores measure similarity between the AI response and reference texts using n-gram matching. Higher BLEU scores indicate greater similarity to the reference material.

Q: Do NLP evaluators require internet connectivity?
A: No, NLP evaluators perform local text analysis and don't require external service calls, making them suitable for offline or latency-sensitive scenarios.

## Reporting and Caching

Q: How does response caching work?
A: The evaluation framework can cache AI responses and evaluation results to avoid repeated evaluations of identical inputs, improving performance and reducing costs.

Q: What reporting capabilities are available?
A: The reporting framework generates comprehensive evaluation reports including scores, trends, detailed analysis, and can export to multiple formats like JSON and HTML.

Q: How do I store evaluation results for audit purposes?
A: Use Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation.Reporting with Azure Storage integration to persist evaluation results and generate audit trails for compliance requirements.

Q: Can I generate reports from cached evaluation data?
A: Yes, the reporting framework can analyze historical evaluation data from cache to generate trend reports and performance analysis over time.

## Custom Evaluators

Q: How do I create a custom evaluator?
A: Implement the IEvaluator interface with your custom evaluation logic in the EvaluateAsync method, returning an EvaluationResult with score and reasoning.

Q: Can custom evaluators use external services?
A: Yes, custom evaluators can call external APIs, databases, or other services as part of their evaluation logic, following async/await patterns.

Q: How do I register custom evaluators with dependency injection?
A: Register your custom evaluator implementation as a service in the DI container and include it in your evaluation pipeline configuration.

Q: Can I combine multiple evaluators in one assessment?
A: Yes, you can run multiple evaluators against the same response and combine their results using the EvaluationBuilder or by implementing aggregation logic.

## Performance and Optimization

Q: How can I optimize evaluation performance?
A: Use response caching, run evaluators in parallel where possible, implement result caching, and choose appropriate evaluator types based on performance requirements.

Q: What's the performance impact of LLM-based evaluators?
A: LLM-based quality evaluators add latency and cost due to additional AI service calls. Consider using NLP evaluators for real-time scenarios or implement caching strategies.

Q: How do I handle evaluation timeouts?
A: Implement timeout policies in your evaluation configuration and consider fallback strategies for when evaluators fail or timeout.

Q: Can I run evaluations in batch mode?
A: Yes, many evaluators support batch processing which is more efficient than individual evaluations, especially for large test datasets.

## Integration and Testing

Q: How do I integrate evaluations into CI/CD pipelines?
A: Create automated tests that run evaluations against test datasets and assert that scores meet quality thresholds before allowing deployments.

Q: Can I use evaluations in unit tests?
A: Yes, evaluation results can be used in assertions within unit tests to ensure AI responses meet quality and safety standards during development.

Q: How do I handle evaluation failures in production?
A: Implement retry policies, fallback evaluators, and graceful degradation strategies to ensure application reliability when evaluations fail.

Q: What's the recommended approach for regression testing AI models?
A: Maintain a test dataset with expected outcomes, run evaluations before and after model updates, and compare performance metrics to detect regressions.

## Troubleshooting

Q: Why are my quality evaluations inconsistent?
A: LLM-based evaluators can have some variability. Consider running multiple evaluations and averaging results, or implementing confidence thresholds.

Q: How do I debug evaluation failures?
A: Check evaluation logs, verify service connectivity for cloud-based evaluators, ensure proper authentication, and validate input data format.

Q: Why are safety evaluations taking too long?
A: Safety evaluators depend on Azure AI Foundry service response times. Implement timeouts, consider caching, and monitor service availability.

Q: What should I do if evaluation costs are too high?
A: Implement cost controls through caching, selective evaluation based on priority, use NLP evaluators where appropriate, and set evaluation budgets.

Q: How do I handle evaluation rate limits?
A: Implement retry policies with exponential backoff, use request queuing, consider evaluation batching, and monitor service quotas.
