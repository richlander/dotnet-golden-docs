# File Types and Artifacts Reference

This document defines all file types used throughout the documentation system, their purposes, and organization patterns.

## File Organization Structure

The documentation system uses a clear separation between core content and processing artifacts:

```text
docs/category/topic/
├── topic-spec.md              # Core content files
├── golden-reference.md
├── qa-pairs.md
├── validation.md
├── index.json
├── _similarities/             # Cross-topic relationship artifacts
│   ├── metadata.json
│   ├── self.md.embedding
│   ├── category.md.embedding
│   └── other-topic.md.embedding
└── _embedding/                # Processing artifacts
    ├── topic-spec.md.embedding
    ├── topic-spec.md._embedding.txt
    ├── topic-spec.md._tokencount.txt
    └── golden-reference.md.embedding
```

## Core Content Files

| File Name | Purpose | Format | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| topic-spec.md | Topic specification and metadata | Structured markdown with tables | Yes | Defines feature relationships, sources, and metadata |
| golden-reference.md | Reference implementation content | Narrative markdown | Yes | High-quality example of expected generated content |
| qa-pairs.md | Question and answer pairs | Structured markdown | Optional | Training data for question-answering systems |
| validation.md | Quality validation criteria | Structured markdown | Optional | Specific validation rules for the topic |
| index.json | Topic metadata and configuration | JSON | Yes | Machine-readable topic configuration |

## Processing Artifacts (_embedding directory)

| File Pattern | Purpose | Format | Generated By | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *.embedding | Vector embeddings of content | Binary/encoded | Embedding pipeline | Semantic vector representations for similarity |
| *._embedding.txt | Human-readable embedding metadata | Text | Embedding pipeline | Debugging and verification of embedding process |
| *._tokencount.txt | Token count analysis | Text | Tokenization pipeline | Token usage statistics for content sizing |

## Relationship Artifacts (_similarities directory)

| File Name | Purpose | Format | Generated By | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| metadata.json | Similarity computation metadata | JSON | Similarity pipeline | Configuration and results of similarity analysis |
| self.md.embedding | Self-similarity baseline | Binary/encoded | Similarity pipeline | Reference embedding for the current topic |
| {category}.md.embedding | Cross-category similarities | Binary/encoded | Similarity pipeline | Embeddings for measuring relationships to other categories |

## Global Infrastructure Files

| File Name | Purpose | Format | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| repos.md | Repository registry | Structured markdown | /docs/ | Central registry of all referenced repositories |
| workflow.md | Usage documentation | Narrative markdown | / | Complete guide for using the documentation system |
| format.md | Formatting standards | Narrative markdown | / | LLM-optimized content formatting rules |
| topic-spec-format.md | Topic specification format | Structured markdown | / | Detailed format specification for topic-spec.md files |
| file-types.md | File type reference | Structured markdown | / | This document - comprehensive file type definitions |

## Format Specification Files

| File Pattern | Purpose | Format | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *-format.md | Format specifications | Structured markdown | / | Detailed format rules for different file types |
| .markdownlint.json | Linter configuration | JSON | / | Markdown linting rules for consistency |

## Configuration and Metadata Files

| File Name | Purpose | Format | Generated | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index.json | Topic metadata | JSON | Manual/Pipeline | Machine-readable topic configuration and status |
| metadata.json | Processing metadata | JSON | Pipeline | Results and configuration from automated processing |
| .gitignore | Version control exclusions | Text | Manual | Files to exclude from version control |

## Processing Pipeline Phases

The file organization reflects two main processing phases:

### Phase 1: Content Generation

- Input: topic-spec.md, repos.md, category context
- Output: golden-reference.md, qa-pairs.md, validation.md
- Focus: Creating high-quality human-readable content

### Phase 2: Embedding and Analysis

- Input: All markdown content from Phase 1
- Output: `_embedding/` and `_similarities/` artifacts
- Focus: Creating machine-readable representations for similarity and retrieval

## File Lifecycle

### Core Content Lifecycle

- Created manually or through content generation tools
- Versioned in git repository
- Subject to format validation and linting
- Updated through normal development workflow

### Processing Artifacts

- Generated automatically by processing pipelines
- Not versioned in git (should be in .gitignore)
- Regenerated as needed from core content
- Organized in dedicated directories (`_embedding`, `_similarities`)

### Infrastructure Files

- Created and maintained manually
- Versioned in git repository
- Updated through normal development workflow
- Subject to format validation

## Validation and Quality Control

### Automated Validation

- Markdownlint compliance for all markdown files
- JSON schema validation for structured data files
- Link validation for URL accessibility
- Table structure validation for consistency

### Manual Review Requirements

- Core content files require human review
- Infrastructure files need careful change management
- Format specifications require comprehensive testing
- Processing artifacts are validated through automated testing

## Best Practices

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for multi-word file names
- Include appropriate file extensions
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Follow established patterns for consistency

### Directory Organization

- Keep core content in main directory
- Use underscore-prefixed directories for artifacts (`_embedding`, `_similarities`)
- Organize by logical grouping (category/topic hierarchy)
- Maintain consistent structure across all topics

### Content Management

- Core content should be human-authored or carefully reviewed
- Processing artifacts should never be manually edited
- Infrastructure files require change management
- Regular cleanup of stale processing artifacts
