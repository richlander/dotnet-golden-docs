    # .NET LLM Documentation Architecture

    A comprehensive system for creating, generating, and validating LLM-optimized documentation with a clear separation between source content and consumption-ready outputs.

    ## Core Philosophy

    The architecture is built on three foundational principles:

    1. **Separation of Concerns**: Source (golden) and consumption (output) graphs operate as distinct entities, enabling different teams with different skillsets to work independently at different paces
    2. **Unified Tooling**: Index and embedding tools work on both graphs using identical formats, maximizing code reuse and operational efficiency
    3. **Layered Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation layers ensure high-quality outputs through similarity testing, token budget validation, and LLM evaluation

    ## Repository Structure

    ├── dotnet-golden-llm-docs/     # Source Graph - Curated content and project coordination
    ├── dotnet-docs-llm-tools/      # Unified Toolchain - Works on both graphs
    └── dotnet-docs-llms/           # Consumption Graph - LLM-optimized outputs
    ```

    ### Source Graph (dotnet-golden-llm-docs)

    **Purpose**: High-quality curated content that serves as the authoritative source for all generated documentation.

    **Key Characteristics**:
    - Human-authored golden reference documents
    - Structured topic specifications with metadata
    - Quality assurance pairs for validation
    - Format documentation and templates
    - Project-wide coordination and architecture

    **Content Types**: See `templates/` directory for detailed format specifications:
    - `golden-reference-format.md` - Authoritative content for each topic
    - `qa-pairs-format.md` - Question-answer pairs for validation
    - `topic-spec-format.md` - Topic metadata and organization
    - `index-format.md` - Graph structure and navigation
    - `validation-format.md` - Quality assurance specifications

    ### Consumption Graph (dotnet-docs-llms)

    **Purpose**: LLM-optimized documentation generated from source content, designed for efficient LLM consumption.

    **Key Characteristics**:
    - Multiple content formats targeting different use cases
    - Token-budgeted documents for efficient processing
    - Embeddings and similarity analysis
    - HAL+JSON navigation structure
    - Direct LLM consumption without source complexity

    **Generated Content Types**: See `../dotnet-golden-llm-docs/templates/` directory for detailed format specifications:
    - `overview.md` - Conceptual foundation
    - `one-shot-{budget}.md` - Complete guides with varying detail levels
    - `one-shot-syntax-{budget}.md` - Pure syntax reference for experienced developers
    - `examples-{budget}.md` - Practical examples and code patterns
    - `troubleshooting.md` - Common problems and solutions
    - `integration.md` - Cross-system patterns
    - `advanced.md` - Edge cases and performance considerations

    ### Unified Toolchain (dotnet-docs-llm-tools)

    **Purpose**: Comprehensive toolchain that operates on both source and consumption graphs using unified formats.

    **Architecture Benefits**:
    - Single codebase scales across both graphs
    - Consistent processing and analysis
    - Shared maintenance and improvement
    - Unified graph format regardless of content differences

    **Core Tools**:

    #### Index Tool
    - Generates coherent and efficient views of all content
    - Creates HAL+JSON navigation structures
    - Works identically on both source and consumption graphs
    - Enables consistent higher-level processing

    #### Embedding Tool
    - Generates semantic embeddings using nomadic embedding model
    - Calculates similarity scores for content validation
    - Provides foundation for all downstream semantic scenarios
    - Enables content discovery and relationship mapping

    #### CopyGraph Tool
    - Performs lossy copy from source to consumption graph
    - Selects valuable documents (golden-reference.md, qa-pairs.md)
    - Excludes source-specific files (index.json, topic-spec.md)
    - Creates initial consumption graph foundation
    - Supports `--clean` for complete output graph reset

    #### ContentGenerator Tool
    - Creates targeted document types within specified token budgets
    - Adapts budget requests based on source content richness
    - Uses frontier models (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet) for superior quality
    - Generates consumption-optimized content formats

    #### Token Counting Tool
    - Validates generated content stays within budget constraints
    - Accepts 10% over budget, warns at 20% under budget
    - Uses matching models for generation and counting consistency
    - Ensures efficient LLM consumption

    #### Similarity Testing Tool
    - Validates supporting content similarity to golden-reference.md
    - Target threshold: >0.7 similarity score
    - Warning threshold: 0.5-0.7 similarity score
    - Error threshold: <0.5 similarity score
    - Ensures content quality and consistency

    #### LlmDocTester
    - Tests LLM ability to answer questions using qa-pairs.md
    - Compares baseline (unassisted) vs assisted (with generated content) performance
    - Validates project value through measurable improvement
    - Provides quantitative assessment of documentation effectiveness

    #### Lexical Search Tool
    - Downloads content from consumption graph using LLM re-ranking
    - Reconstitutes consumption graph one query at a time
    - Enables dynamic content discovery and retrieval

    ## Process Flow

    ### 1. Source Content Creation
    - Write high-quality source content in specified formats
    - Leverage LLM assistance for content creation after establishing patterns
    - Continuously adapt standards based on review and evaluation
    - Update existing topics to maintain consistency with current standards

    ### 2. Graph Scaffolding
    - Index tool generates rich navigation structure
    - Embedding tool creates semantic analysis foundation
    - Both tools provide essential graph infrastructure

    ### 3. Graph Copy and Foundation
    - CopyGraph tool copies valuable documents to consumption graph
    - Creates initial embeddings for copied content
    - Generates representative index.json for consumption graph
    - Establishes foundation for content generation

    ### 4. Content Generation
    - ContentGenerator creates targeted document types within token budgets
    - Adapts budget requests based on source content quality
    - Uses frontier models for superior content quality

    ### 5. Graph Completion
    - Index and embedding tools process new content
    - Update consumption graph with complete navigation and analysis
    - Ensure all generated content is properly represented

    ### 6. Validation and Quality Assurance
    - Token counting validates budget compliance
    - Similarity testing ensures content quality consistency
    - LlmDocTester validates practical effectiveness

    - HAL+JSON navigation provides structured access
    - Multiple content formats serve different consumption patterns

    ## Model Strategy

    ### Embedding Model: Nomadic
    - **Rationale**: High-quality embeddings available for free via Ollama
    - **Usage**: Both source and consumption graphs
    - **Infrastructure**: Local Ollama server (very efficient/effective with 16GB VRAM capacity)

    ### Content Generation: Frontier Models (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet)
    - **Rationale**: Superior quality essential for content generation
    - **Usage**: ContentGenerator tool for all generated content
    - **Quality**: Vastly superior to local alternatives for content creation

    ### Token Counting Strategy
    - **Source Graph**: Nomadic embedding model for consistency / low-cost
    - **Consumption Graph**: Same model used for generation to ensure budget accuracy
    - **Benefit**: Generation targets and counting validation perfectly aligned
